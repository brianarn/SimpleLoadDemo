# Simple Load Demo

A friend asked me for a simple example of using jQuery to load files from a server, so I figured I'd make the example into a simple little demo and put it up here.

## Trying it out yourself

Simply just clone it, either to a server or locally, and load up the index.html file into a browser. Some browsers may not like running it directly from disk, so running it through a server (be it something on localhost or in your hosting plan) is likely going to be a better option.

## Caveats

It loads jQuery from the Google CDN, so, y'know, you'll need an internet connection for it to work right, but if you're reading this, I suspect you have that.
